This is a simple reddit bot designed to take F7U12 rage comics and do a simple bit of OCR on them. It should then post a comment on the comic, which will allow searching for text in the images.

Future directions this could take include accessibility work and spelling correction in the comics themselves.

Current state : pre-alpha. Does not access reddit or recognise text, only segments letters so far.
